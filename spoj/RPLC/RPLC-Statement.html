<p>Please, help him find when he will be in the perfect moment to drink all the cokes.</p> 
<h3>Input</h3> 
<p>Will start with an integer T denoting the number of test cases, then, T lines will follow, for each test case, there will be an integer N, then, in the next line will be N integers, this will be the number of cokes, and the values of the cokes in the floor (the positive one gives energy, the negative ones will take his energy).</p> 
<h3>Output</h3> 
<p>Each test case will output the string “<tt>Scenario #i: </tt>“ where i is the number of test case analyzed, followed by the minimum energy required by David to pass the street.</p>
