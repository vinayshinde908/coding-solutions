<p>We define the LEVEL of a triangle as in the following illustrative image:<br> <img src="../../../content/duonghanguyen:tricount.png" alt=""><br> <strong>Task:</strong> Your task is very easy. All you have to do is to count all triangles in the biggest one (Level N).</p> 
<h3>Input</h3> 
<p>The first line of the input contains an integer T (T ≤ 10000) - the number of test cases and T lines follow. Each line contains an integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 10<sup>6</sup>) which is the level of the triangle in that test case.</p> 
<h3>Output</h3> 
<p>For each test case, you should write a seperate line: the number of triangles in the biggest one (Level N). (All answers will fit within the range of a 64-bit integer)</p> 
<h3>Example</h3> 
<pre><strong>Input:</strong><br>3<br>1<br>2<br>3<br><br><strong>Output:</strong><br>1<br>5<br>13<br></pre>
