<p> You would have been fed up with competitive programming questions so far, now it is time to solve little math. </p> 
<p> Assume you have a equation A * x - B * y = 0 </p> 
<p> For a given value of <b>A</b> and <b>B</b>, find the minimum positive integer value of <b>x</b> and <b>y</b> that satisfies this equation. </p> 
<h3>Input</h3> 
<p> First line contains <b>T</b>, number of test cases 0 &lt;= <b>T</b> &lt;=1000 followed by <b>T</b> lines. </p> 
<p> First line of each test case contains two space seperated integers <b>A</b> and <b>B</b>. 1 &lt;= <b>A</b>, <b>B</b> &lt;=1 000 000 000. </p> 
<h3>Output</h3> 
<p> For each test case, output a single line containing two integers <b>x</b> and <b>y</b> (seperated by a single space). </p> 
<h3>Example</h3> 
<pre><b>Input:</b>
1
2 3

<b>Output:</b>
3 2</pre> 
<p><b>Note:</b> </p>
<ul> 
 <li>Brute force won't pass the given constraint.</li> 
 <li>Negative number cases are avoided to make the problem easy.</li>
