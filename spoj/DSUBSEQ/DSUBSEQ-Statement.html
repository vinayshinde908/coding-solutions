<p>Given a string, count the number of distinct subsequences of it ( including empty subsequence ). For the uninformed, A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. <br>For example, "AGH" is a subsequence of "ABCDEFGH" while "AHG" is not. </p>
<h3>Input</h3> 
<p>First line of input contains an integer T which is equal to the number of test cases. You are required to process all test cases. Each of next T lines contains a string s. </p>
<h3>Output</h3> 
<p>Output consists of T lines. Ith line in the output corresponds to the number of distinct subsequences of ith input string. Since, this number could be very large, you need to output ans%1000000007 where ans is the number of distinct subsequences. </p>
<h3>Example</h3> 
<pre>
<b>Input:</b>
3
AAA
ABCDEFG
CODECRAFT


<b>Output:</b>
4

496
</pre> 
<h3>Constraints and Limits</h3> 
<p>T ≤ 100, length(S) ≤ 100000<br> All input strings shall contain only uppercase letters. </p>
