<p> You are working for Macrohard company in data structures department. After failing your previous task about key insertion you were asked to write a new data structure that would be able to return quickly k-th order statistics in the array segment. </p>
<p> That is, given an array a[1 ... n] of different integer numbers, your program must answer a series of questions Q(i, j, k) in the form: "What would be the k-th number in a[i ... j] segment, if this segment was sorted?" </p>
<p> For example, consider the array a = (1, 5, 2, 6, 3, 7, 4). Let the question be Q(2, 5, 3). The segment a[2 ... 5] is (5, 2, 6, 3). If we sort this segment, we get (2, 3, 5, 6), the third number is 5, and therefore the answer to the question is 5. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Input</h3> 
<p></p>
<p> The first line of the input contains n — the size of the array, and m — the number of questions to answer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 5000). </p>
<p> The second line contains n different integer numbers not exceeding 10^9 by their absolute values — the array for which the answers should be given. </p>
<p> The following m lines contain question descriptions, each description consists of three numbers: i, j, and k (1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n, 1 ≤ k ≤ j - i + 1) and represents the question Q(i, j, k). </p>
