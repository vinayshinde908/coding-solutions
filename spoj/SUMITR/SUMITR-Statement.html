<p> Let us consider a triangle of numbers in which a number appears in the first line, two numbers appear in the second line etc. Develop a program which will compute the largest of the sums of numbers that appear on the paths starting from the top towards the base, so that: </p>
<ul> 
 <li> on each path the next number is located on the row below, more precisely either directly below or below and one place to the right; </li> 
 <li> the number of rows is strictly positive, but less than 100; </li> 
 <li> all numbers are positive integers between O and 99. </li> 
</ul> 
<p> Take care about your fingers, do not use more than <b>256</b> bytes of code. </p>
<h3>Input</h3> 
<p> In the first line integer n - the number of test cases (equal to about 1000). Then n test cases follow. Each test case starts with the number of lines which is followed by their content. </p>
<h3>Output</h3> 
<p> For each test case write the determined value in a separate line. </p>
<h3>Example</h3>
