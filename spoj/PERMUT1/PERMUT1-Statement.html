<p> Let A = [a<sub>1</sub>,a<sub>2</sub>,...,a<sub>n</sub>] be a permutation of integers 1,2,...,n. A pair of indices (i,j), 1&lt;=i&lt;=j&lt;=n, is an <i>inversion</i> of the permutation A if a<sub>i</sub>&gt;a<sub>j</sub>. We are given integers n&gt;0 and k&gt;=0. What is the number of n-element permutations containing exactly k inversions? </p> 
<p> For instance, the number of 4-element permutations with exactly 1 inversion equals 3. </p> 
<h3>Task</h3> 
<p> Write a program which for each data set from a sequence of several data sets: </p> 
<div align="left"> 
 <ul> 
  <li> reads integers n and k from input, </li>
  <li> computes the number of n-element permutations with exactly k inversions, </li>
  <li> writes the result to output. </li>
 </ul> 
</div> 
<h3>Input</h3> 
<p> The first line of the input file contains one integer d, 1&lt;=d&lt;=10, which is the number of data sets. The data sets follow. Each data set occupies one line of the input file and contains two integers n (1&lt;=n&lt;=12) and k (0&lt;=k&lt;=98) separated by a single space. </p> 
<h3>Output</h3> 
<p> The i-th line of the output file should contain one integer - the number of n-element permutations with exactly k inversions. </p>
