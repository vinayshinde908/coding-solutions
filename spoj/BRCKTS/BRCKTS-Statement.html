<p> We will call a <b>bracket word</b> any word constructed out of two sorts of characters: the opening bracket "(" and the closing bracket ")". Among these words we will distinguish <b>correct bracket expressions</b>. These are such bracket words in which the brackets can be matched into pairs such that </p>
<ul> 
 <li>every pair consists of an opening bracket and a closing bracket appearing further in the bracket word</li> 
 <li>for every pair the part of the word between the brackets of this pair has equal number of opening and closing brackets </li> 
</ul> On a bracket word one can do the following operations: 
<ul> 
 <li><b>replacement</b> -- changes the i-th bracket into the opposite one</li> 
 <li><b>check</b> -- if the word is a correct bracket expression</li> 
</ul> 
<p></p> 
<h3>Task</h3> 
<p> Write a program which </p> 
<div align="justify"> 
 <ul> 
  <li> reads (from standard input) the bracket word and the sequence of operations performed, </li> 
  <li> for every check operation determines if the current bracket word is a correct bracket expression, </li> 
  <li> writes out the outcome (to standard output). </li> 
 </ul>
</div> 
<h3>Input</h3> 
<p> Ten test cases (given one under another, you have to process all!). Each of the test cases is a series of lines. The first line of a test consists of a single number <i>n (1&lt;=n&lt;=30000)</i> denoting the length of the bracket word. The second line consists of <i>n</i> brackets, not separated by any spaces. The third line consists of a single number <i>m</i> -- the number of operations. Each of the following <i>m</i> lines carries a number <i>k</i> denoting the operation performed. <i>k=0</i> denotes the check operation, <i>k&gt;0</i> denotes replacement of <i>k</i>-th bracket by the opposite. </p> 
<h3>Output</h3> 
<p> For every test case your program should print a line:<br> Test i:<br> where i is replaced by the number of the test and in the following lines, for every check operation in the i-th test your program should print a line with the word YES, if the current bracket word is a correct bracket expression, and a line with a word NO otherwise. (There should be as many lines as check operations in the test.) </p>
